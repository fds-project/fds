# Install the Python environment, backend web server and the Python package manager 
apt-get install python3 php5 mysql-server php5-mysql python3-pip git openssl libssl-dev

# Restart the webserver
service apache2 restart

# Clone the repo
git clone [this GIT URL]
cd ics-fds

# Install the required dependencies
pip3 install -r requirements.txt

# Set-up the backend environment
mkdir /var/www/html/fds/
cp -rf backend/* /var/www/html/fds/

# Set-up the database
mysql -u root -p
Enter the password you configured during the server installation and execute the following commands:

> CREATE USER `fds`@`localhost` IDENTIFIED BY 'SecurePassword';

> CREATE DATABASE fds;

> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON fds.* TO `fds`@`localhost` IDENTIFIED BY 'SecurePassword';

> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

> exit


Don't forget to change the default password to something secure :)

mysql -u fds -p fds < database.sql
> Enter the password you entered for the wasec user

Open /var/www/html/fds/includes/db.php with your favorite text-editor (VIM!!1!)
Edit the password so it matches the fds@localhost MySQL password

Explore the application by browsing to http://localhost/fds/
The default username and password are:
USER: admin@fds.local
PASS: Test123

Remote connections are also allowed by the default apache2 configuration so the private IP should also work.

The API endpoint will be available at:
http://localhost/fds/parser.php

A more heavy-weight API with encryption support is available at:
http://localhost/fds/parser_extended.php

You can start the server by running the following commands:
python3 main.py
